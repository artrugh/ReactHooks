React Hooks - Basic

Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.

Let's have a look coding the tipical counterApp using a class and a function as well!

Hooks are JS functions but
 -Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
 -Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. (There is just one other valid place to call Hooks — your own custom Hooks. We’ll learn about them in a moment.)
